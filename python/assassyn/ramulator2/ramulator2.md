# PyRamulator - Python Wrapper for Ramulator2

## Summary

PyRamulator provides a Python interface to the Ramulator2 memory simulator through C++ wrapper libraries. This module enables Assassyn's simulator backend to integrate with external memory simulation capabilities, supporting the [Module](../ir/module/module.md) pipeline stage architecture described in the design documents. The wrapper handles cross-platform shared library loading and provides callback-based memory request handling for simulation coordination.

## Exposed Interfaces

### PyRamulator Class

The main interface class that encapsulates memory simulation functionality.

#### `__init__(config_path: str)`

Initializes a new PyRamulator instance with the specified configuration file.

**Parameters:**
- `config_path` (str): Path to the YAML configuration file (e.g., `example_config.yaml`)

**Raises:**
- `RuntimeError`: If the CRamualator2Wrapper instance cannot be created

**Example:**
```python
from assassyn.ramulator2 import PyRamulator
sim = PyRamulator("/path/to/config.yaml")
```

#### `get_memory_tCK() -> float`

Returns the memory clock period (tCK) in nanoseconds.

**Returns:**
- `float`: Memory clock period in nanoseconds

**Example:**
```python
clock_period = sim.get_memory_tCK()
print(f"Memory clock period: {clock_period} ns")
```

#### `send_request(addr: int, is_write: bool, callback, ctx) -> bool`

Sends a memory request to the simulated memory system.

**Parameters:**
- `addr` (int): Memory address for the request
- `is_write` (bool): `True` for write request, `False` for read request
- `callback`: Python function to call when request completes (for read requests)
- `ctx`: Context object passed to the callback function

**Returns:**
- `bool`: `True` if request was successfully enqueued, `False` otherwise

**Raises:**
- `ValueError`: If callback is `None`

**Example:**
```python
def request_callback(req, cycle):
    print(f"Request completed at cycle {cycle}: addr={req.addr}")

success = sim.send_request(0x1000, False, request_callback, 42)
```

#### `frontend_tick()`

Advances the frontend simulation by one clock cycle. This processes incoming requests and manages the request queue.

**Example:**
```python
sim.frontend_tick()
```

#### `memory_system_tick()`

Advances the memory system simulation by one clock cycle. This processes memory operations and updates timing.

**Example:**
```python
sim.memory_system_tick()
```

#### `finish()`

Finalizes the simulation and collects statistics. Should be called when simulation is complete.

**Example:**
```python
sim.finish()
```

#### `__del__()`

Destructor that automatically cleans up the underlying C++ wrapper instance when the Python object is garbage collected.

### Request Structure

The `Request` class represents a memory request with the following key fields:

- `addr` (int64): Memory address
- `arrive` (int64): Cycle when request arrived
- `depart` (int64): Cycle when request completed
- `command` (int): Memory command type
- `is_stat_updated` (bool): Whether statistics were updated

### `cwrapper_lib_path() -> str`

Gets the path to the C wrapper shared library by reading the `.cwrapper-lib-path` file generated by CMake.

**Returns:**
- `str`: Path to the C wrapper shared library (without extension)

**Raises:**
- `FileNotFoundError`: If the `.cwrapper-lib-path` file is not found

**Explanation:**
This function reads the path from the `.cwrapper-lib-path` file created by the [wrapper build](../../../tools/c-ramulator2-wrapper/CMakeLists.txt) process. The result is cached to avoid repeated file I/O operations. The function requires the `ASSASSYN_HOME` environment variable to be set to locate the build directory.

### `ramulator2_lib_path() -> str`

Gets the path to the Ramulator2 shared library by reading the `.ramulator2-lib-path` file generated by CMake.

**Returns:**
- `str`: Path to the Ramulator2 shared library (without extension)

**Raises:**
- `FileNotFoundError`: If the `.ramulator2-lib-path` file is not found

**Explanation:**
Similar to `cwrapper_lib_path()`, this function reads the path from the `.ramulator2-lib-path` file created by the build process. The result is cached to avoid repeated file I/O operations. The function requires the `ASSASSYN_HOME` environment variable to be set to locate the build directory.

### `load_shared_library(lib_path: str) -> ctypes.CDLL`

Loads a shared library with fallback for different extensions and platform-specific handling.

**Parameters:**
- `lib_path` (str): Path to the shared library (without extension)

**Returns:**
- `ctypes.CDLL`: Loaded shared library object

**Raises:**
- `FileNotFoundError`: If no compatible library is found with any supported extension

**Explanation:**
This function handles cross-platform shared library loading with the following behavior:
1. Checks if the path already has an extension and loads it directly
2. Tries different extensions in order of preference: `.dylib` (macOS), `.so` (Linux), `.dll` (Windows)
3. Uses `RTLD_GLOBAL` mode on macOS for compatibility with recursive shared object dependencies as documented in [simulator.md](../codegen/simulator/simulator.md)
4. Raises a clear error message if no compatible library is found

## Usage Pattern

A typical simulation loop follows this pattern:

```python
from assassyn.ramulator2 import PyRamulator, Request

# Initialize simulator
sim = PyRamulator("config.yaml")

# Simulation loop
for cycle in range(num_cycles):
    # Send requests
    if should_send_request:
        sim.send_request(address, is_write, callback, context)
    
    # Advance simulation
    sim.frontend_tick()
    sim.memory_system_tick()

# Clean up
sim.finish()
```

## Dependencies

The PyRamulator module requires:
- `libwrapper`: Built from `tools/c-ramulator2-wrapper/CRamualator2Wrapper.cpp` (with OS-appropriate extension)
- `libramulator`: Core Ramulator2 library from `3rd-party/ramulator2/` (with OS-appropriate extension)
- Python `ctypes` module for C library interfacing

## Cross-Platform Support

PyRamulator automatically handles different operating systems by:
1. Detecting the current OS using `sys.platform`
2. Loading the appropriate shared library extension (`.so`, `.dll`, or `.dylib`)
3. Providing fallback mechanisms to try alternative extensions if the primary one fails
4. Raising a clear error message if no compatible library is found

## Building Requirements

Before using PyRamulator, ensure the wrapper library is built:

```bash
cd tools/c-ramulator2-wrapper
mkdir -p build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```

This creates `libwrapper` (with the appropriate OS extension) in the `build/lib/` directory. PyRamulator locates and loads the correct shared library for your platform.

## Cross-Validation Suite

PyRamulator is part of a comprehensive cross-validation suite that ensures consistency across different language implementations:

- **C++ Test**: `tools/c-ramulator2-wrapper/test.cpp`
- **Python Test**: `python/unit-tests/test_ramulator2.py`
- **Rust Test**: `tools/rust-sim-runtime/src/test_ramulator2.rs`

All implementations must produce **identical output** when given the same:
- Configuration file
- Request sequence
- Simulation parameters

This validates that the language bindings correctly interface with the core `libramulator` library (with OS-appropriate extension) and maintain behavioral consistency across different programming languages and operating systems.
