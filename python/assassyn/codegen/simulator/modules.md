# Module Generation

This module generates the simulation of each Assassyn [module](../../ir/module/),
including [pipeline stage](../../ir/module/module.py) and [downstream](../../ir/module/downstream.py)
in the folder `modules/` of the generated code.

## Section 0. Summary

The module generation system translates Assassyn IR modules into Rust simulation code. Each module (both pipeline stages and downstream modules) is converted into a Rust function that can be executed by the simulator host. In addition to the existing DRAM callback generation and cross-module exposure tracking, the generator now understands external SystemVerilog modules: it threads FFI handle specifications into every module, emits typed setters/getters for cross-language ports, and injects the glue that keeps external wires coherent with the simulator state.

## Section 1. Exposed Interfaces

### `dump_modules`

```python
def dump_modules(sys: SysBuilder, modules_dir: Path) -> bool:
```

Generates individual module files in the modules/ directory for simulator code generation.

This function prepares `modules/mod.rs` (with the imports required by generated code, including `libloading`, `VecDeque`, and `sim_runtime` utilities), gathers external FFI specifications attached to the system, and then iterates over every module/downstream to create `<module>.rs` implementations.

**Parameters:**
- `sys`: The system builder containing all modules to be generated
- `modules_dir`: Path to the modules directory where files will be created

**Returns:**
- `bool`: Always returns True upon successful completion

**Explanation:** This function is the main entry point for module code generation. It creates the modules directory, writes `mod.rs` with the shared `use` statements, and instantiates an `ElaborateModule` visitor seeded with the system-wide external FFI specs. For each module it writes `<module>.rs`, dumps DRAM callbacks when necessary, and lets the visitor produce the function body. External SystemVerilog modules are emitted as Rust stubs that expose their FFI handles without generating a body, allowing the runtime to call into shared objects. The generated code follows the simulator execution model described in [simulator.md](../../../docs/design/internal/simulator.md), where each module function returns a boolean indicating successful execution or blocking by `wait_until` intrinsics.

## Section 2. Internal Helpers

### `ElaborateModule`

```python
class ElaborateModule(Visitor):
```

Visitor class for elaborating modules with multi-port write support.

**Explanation:** This visitor class implements the core module-to-Rust translation logic. It now accepts optional `external_specs` so that generated code can invoke the correct FFI helper for every external SystemVerilog module. During construction it also precomputes `external_value_assignments` (mapping exported IR values to external sinks) and tracks which assignments have already been emitted, avoiding duplicate setter calls. The visitor traverses the IR representation of modules and generates corresponding Rust code that can be executed by the simulator, handling expressions, blocks, immediate values, and the new external wire operations.

#### `__init__`

```python
def __init__(self, sys: SysBuilder):
```

Initialize the module elaborator.

**Parameters:**
- `sys`: The system builder containing modules to elaborate
- `external_specs`: Optional mapping of external module names to FFI descriptors

**Explanation:** Sets up the visitor with system context, initializes indentation tracking for code formatting, captures the FFI spec registry, and precomputes which internal values must be forwarded into external modules by calling `collect_external_value_assignments`. The visitor also tracks which assignments have already been emitted so that repeated reads in a single cycle do not re-trigger setters.

#### `visit_module`

```python
def visit_module(self, node: Module) -> str:
```

Visit a module and generate its Rust implementation.

**Parameters:**
- `node`: The module to visit and generate code for

**Returns:**
- `str`: Complete Rust function implementation for the module

**Explanation:** Generates a Rust function with signature `pub fn <module_name>(sim: &mut Simulator) -> bool`. External SystemVerilog modules that do not have a Python body are short-circuited to `visit_external_module`, producing a stub that simply returns `true` (the FFI handle drives the real behaviour). For internal modules the visitor traverses the body and returns `true` on success, mirroring the simulator execution model where `false` indicates the module was blocked by `wait_until`.

#### `visit_expr`

```python
def visit_expr(self, node: Expr) -> str:
```

Visit an expression and generate its Rust implementation.

**Parameters:**
- `node`: The expression to visit and generate code for

**Returns:**
- `str`: Rust code for the expression with proper indentation

**Explanation:** Delegates expression code generation to the [_expr](./_expr/) module using `codegen_expr`, but intercepts the cases that involve external modules:
- **WireAssign**: Uses `codegen_external_wire_assign` to emit setter calls for external handles. When the helper returns code, the visitor plugs in the generated snippet (typed via `ValueCastTo`) and avoids emitting default expression code.
- **WireRead**: Optionally replaces the generated code with a custom snippet from `codegen_external_wire_read` so simulator reads go through the cached FFI handle.
- **Exposed Values**: When an expression is valued and needs exposure, the visitor generates `let` bindings plus `sim.<id>_value = Some(<clone>)`. If the value feeds an external module input, the visitor also emits the corresponding `handle.set_*` calls exactly once per (module, value) pair.

Location comments (`// @<location>`) are preserved for easier debugging. Expressions that do not need custom handling fall back to the standard `_expr` codegen.

#### `visit_int_imm`

```python
def visit_int_imm(self, int_imm) -> str:
```

Visit an integer immediate value and generate its Rust representation.

**Parameters:**
- `int_imm`: The integer immediate value to convert

**Returns:**
- `str`: Rust code that casts the value to the appropriate type

**Explanation:** Converts Python integer values to Rust with proper type casting using `ValueCastTo`. This handles the conversion from Python's arbitrary precision integers to Rust's typed integer system. The function uses `dump_rval_ref` to determine the appropriate Rust type for the immediate value.

#### `visit_block`

```python
def visit_block(self, node: Block) -> str:
```

Visit a block and generate its Rust implementation.

**Parameters:**
- `node`: The block to visit (can be Block, CondBlock, or CycledBlock)

**Returns:**
- `str`: Rust code for the block with proper control flow

**Explanation:** Handles different block types:
- **CondBlock**: Evaluates the condition (emitting it if the condition itself contains expressions) then wraps the child body in an `if`.
- **CycledBlock**: Generates `if sim.stamp / 100 == <cycle> { ... }` for time-based execution.
- **Regular Block**: Processes all elements sequentially.

The function maintains proper indentation, avoids duplicate visits via an identity set, and gracefully handles `RecordValue` nodes by delegating to their underlying expression. When entering or leaving a conditional block the indentation is adjusted, ensuring the emitted Rust is formatted and ready for `cargo fmt`.

#### `visit_external_module`

```python
def visit_external_module(self, node: ExternalSV):
    """Emit a stub implementation for an external module."""
```

**Explanation:** Generates a minimal Rust function for external SystemVerilog modules. Because the real behaviour lives in dynamically loaded shared libraries, the stub simply marks that the module is driven externally (`// External module ...`) and returns `true` after silencing the unused `sim` parameter. This keeps the simulator buildable even when external modules have no Python-visible body.

## Generated Code Structure

### DRAM Module Callbacks

DRAM modules are special because Ramulator2 uses a callback-based response interface.
For each DRAM module, a callback function is generated:

```rust
pub extern "C" fn callback_of_<dram_name>(
    req: *mut Request, ctx: *mut c_void) {
    // Handle read/write responses based on req.type_id
}
```

**Explanation:**
- `req.type_id == 0`: Read response - sets `read_succ = true`, populates the data buffer with placeholder bytes, and records that the response is a read.
- `req.type_id == 1`: Write response - sets `write_succ = true` and marks the response as a write.
- Both paths update `sim.request_stamp_map_table`, ensuring the simulator can translate DRAM responses back to the stamp that issued the request.
- Refer to [ramulator2.md](../../../../tools/rust-sim-runtime/src/ramulator2.md) for `Request` details.

This callback function is dumped in the same file as the DRAM module to minimize its visibility while keeping linkage straightforward.

### Module Function Structure

Each generated module function follows this pattern:

```rust
pub fn <module_name>(sim: &mut Simulator) -> bool {
    // Generated module body
    true
}
```

**Explanation:** The function returns `true` for successful execution or `false` when blocked by `wait_until` intrinsics. This return value is used by the simulator host to determine whether to pop events from the module's event queue.

### Expression Exposure

When expressions are used by other modules or external SV bindings, they are exposed in the simulator context:

```rust
let foo = { /* expression */ };
sim.foo_value = Some(foo.clone());
sim.external_handle.set_bar(ValueCastTo::<_>::cast(&foo));
```

**Explanation:** This mechanism enables cross-module communication by making computed values available to other modules through the shared simulator context and, when necessary, by pushing the value into an external FFI handle. Exposure requirements are determined by the [expr_externally_used](../../analysis/external_usage.py) analysis and the `collect_external_value_assignments` helper.

### Debug Support

The module generation includes source location tracking. When available, location comments are added as `// @<location>` to aid in debugging and tracing generated code back to the original source.
