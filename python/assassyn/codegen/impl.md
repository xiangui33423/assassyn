# Code Generation Implementation

This module provides the main entry point for code generation in Assassyn, coordinating between simulator and Verilog backends to generate executable implementations from the intermediate representation (IR).

## Summary

The `codegen` function serves as the central dispatcher for code generation, taking a system builder and configuration parameters to generate either a simulator (Rust-based) or Verilog implementation, or both. It coordinates the elaboration process for each backend and returns the generated artifacts.

## Exposed Interfaces

### `codegen`

```python
def codegen(sys: SysBuilder, **kwargs):
    '''
    The help function to generate the assassyn IR builder for the given system

    Args:
        sys (SysBuilder): The system to generate the builder for
        simulator: Whether to generate a simulator
        verilog: Verilog simulator target (if any)
        idle_threshold: Idle threshold for the simulator
        sim_threshold: Simulation threshold
        random: Whether to randomize module execution order
        resource_base: Path to resource files
        fifo_depth: Default FIFO depth
    '''
```

**Explanation**

This function serves as the main entry point for code generation in Assassyn. It coordinates the generation of both simulator and Verilog implementations based on the provided configuration parameters.

The function performs the following steps:

1. **Simulator Generation**: If the `simulator` flag is set in kwargs, it calls `simulator.elaborate()` to generate a Rust-based simulator implementation. This creates a complete simulator project with Rust source files and returns a manifest path.

2. **Verilog Generation**: If the `verilog` flag is set in kwargs, it calls `verilog.elaborate()` to generate Verilog source files for hardware synthesis. This creates SystemVerilog modules implementing the credit-based pipeline architecture described in the [pipeline design document](/docs/design/internal/pipeline.md).

3. **Return Artifacts**: Returns a tuple containing:
   - `simulator_manifest`: Path to the simulator manifest file (if generated)
   - `verilog_path`: Path to the generated Verilog directory (if generated)

The function respects the architectural design decisions documented in [arch.md](/docs/design/arch/arch.md) and [module.md](/docs/design/internal/module.md), ensuring that generated code follows the credit-based pipeline execution model and module generation patterns.

**Project-specific Knowledge Required**:
- Understanding of [SysBuilder](/python/assassyn/builder.md) for system representation
- Knowledge of [simulator elaboration](/python/assassyn/codegen/simulator/elaborate.md) process
- Understanding of [Verilog elaboration](/python/assassyn/codegen/verilog/elaborate.md) process
- Reference to [backend configuration](/python/assassyn/backend.md) for parameter usage

**Usage Context**: This function is primarily called from [backend.py](/python/assassyn/backend.md) as part of the main code generation pipeline, where it receives a configured system builder and elaboration parameters.
