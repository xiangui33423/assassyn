# Verilog Design Generation

This module provides the main Verilog design generation functionality, including the CIRCTDumper class that converts Assassyn IR into CIRCT-compatible Verilog code and the generate_design function that orchestrates the complete design generation process. The generator also accumulates the metadata required to stitch together external SystemVerilog modules and multi-port array writers.

## Summary

**Multi-Port Array Architecture Design Decisions:** The Verilog design generation implements a multi-port array architecture with specific design decisions:

1. **Port Arbitration**: Multiple modules can write to the same array through different ports
2. **Port Indexing**: Each write port gets a unique index for compile-time allocation
3. **Port Manager Integration**: Global port manager tracks all port assignments
4. **Conflict Resolution**: Port conflicts are resolved at compile time
5. **Port Metadata**: Port metadata is accumulated for external module integration

**FIFO Handshaking Protocols:** The Verilog design generation implements FIFO handshaking protocols:

1. **Credit-Based Flow Control**: FIFOs use credit-based flow control for backpressure
2. **Valid/Ready Signals**: Standard valid/ready handshaking for data transfer
3. **FIFO Depth Configuration**: FIFO depth is configurable per pipeline stage
4. **FIFO Naming Convention**: FIFOs follow a consistent naming convention
5. **FIFO Integration**: FIFOs are integrated with the credit-based pipeline architecture

**External Module Integration Process:** The Verilog design generation integrates external SystemVerilog modules:

1. **External Module Detection**: External modules are detected during system analysis
2. **FFI Handle Generation**: FFI handles are generated for external module communication
3. **Port Mapping**: External module ports are mapped to internal signals
4. **Signal Routing**: External module signals are routed through the design
5. **Co-simulation Support**: External modules are integrated for co-simulation

**Credit-Based Pipeline Implementation Details:** The Verilog design generation implements the credit-based pipeline:

1. **Pipeline Stage Communication**: Pipeline stages communicate through event queues
2. **Credit Management**: Credits are managed for flow control
3. **Trigger Counter Plumbing**: Trigger counters are plumbed through the design
4. **Stage Register Management**: Stage registers are managed for pipeline state
5. **Asynchronous Call Handling**: Asynchronous calls are handled through the pipeline

**Function Name Inconsistencies (Documented as Potential Improvements):** The Verilog design generation has some function names that don't match their actual implementation:

1. **`cleanup_post_generation`**: Actually generates signal routing, not cleanup
2. **`generate_sram_blackbox_files`**: Generates both blackbox and regular modules
3. **`dump_rval`**: Actually generates signal references, not just values

These inconsistencies are documented as potential improvements for future refactoring.

## Exposed Interfaces

### `generate_design`

```python
def generate_design(fname: Union[str, Path], sys: SysBuilder):
    """Generate a complete Verilog design file for the system."""
```

**Explanation**

This function generates a complete Verilog design file for an Assassyn system. It performs the following steps:

1. **File Setup**: Opens the output file and writes the standard CIRCT header
2. **SRAM Module Generation**: Generates SRAM blackbox module definitions for each SRAM in the system
3. **System Processing**: Uses CIRCTDumper to visit and generate code for all modules in the system
4. **Code Output**: Writes the generated code to the file
5. **Log Return**: Returns the generated log statements for testbench integration

The function handles SRAM modules specially by:
- Extracting SRAM parameters (data width, address width, array name)
- Generating parameterized SRAM blackbox modules
- Creating proper memory interface definitions

- Knowledge of [SRAM memory model](/python/assassyn/ir/memory/sram.md)

## Internal Classes

### `CIRCTDumper`

```python
class CIRCTDumper(Visitor):
    """Dumps IR to CIRCT-compatible Verilog code."""
```

**Explanation**

The CIRCTDumper class is the main visitor that converts Assassyn IR into Verilog code. It inherits from the Visitor pattern and implements the credit-based pipeline architecture. The class maintains extensive state for managing:

1. **Execution Control**: `wait_until`, `cond_stack`, and `finish_conditions` track predicate stacking, wait-until clauses, and FINISH intrinsics.
2. **Module State**: `current_module`, `_exposes`, `module_ctx`, and `exposed_ports_to_add` capture which values need to become ports.
3. **Array Management**: `array_write_port_mapping`, `array_users`, `sram_payload_arrays`, and `memory_defs` orchestrate multi-port array writers and SRAM payloads.
4. **External Integration**: `pending_external_inputs`, `instantiated_external_modules`, `external_wire_assignments`, `external_wire_assignment_keys`, `external_wire_outputs`, and `external_modules` keep track of how external SystemVerilog modules are instantiated and how their signals flow from producers to consumers.
5. **Expression Naming**: `expr_to_name` and `name_counters` guarantee deterministic signal names whenever expression results must be reused across statements.
6. **Code Generation**: `code`, `logs`, and `indent` store emitted lines and diagnostic information used later by the testbench.

#### Key Methods

**`visit_system`**: Generates code for the entire system by calling `generate_system()`

**`visit_module`**: Generates a complete Verilog module with the following phases:
1. **Analysis Phase**: Processes the module body, collecting exposes, async call metadata, and external wiring information.
2. **Port Generation**: Calls `generate_module_ports()` to create module interfaces, using the captured expose data.
3. **Code Integration**: Combines the collected body statements with the module boilerplate and generator decorators.
4. **Special Handling**: Resets external bookkeeping between modules, emits SRAM-specific prelude code, and avoids instantiating pure external stubs.

**`visit_array`**: Generates multi-port array modules with:
- Write port interfaces for each writing module (based on `array_write_port_mapping`)
- Multi-port arbitration loops that prioritise the last matching port
- Register-based storage with programmable reset values
- Outputs that feed downstream module array readers

**`visit_expr`**: Delegates expression generation to the expression dispatch system, emits helpful `#` comments with source locations, exposes valued expressions when `expr_externally_used` requires it, and defers wire reads to the external wiring machinery when applicable.

**`visit_block`**: Manages conditional and cycled blocks by maintaining a condition stack for proper predicate generation; when a conditional contains logging or other side effects it exposes the condition to the outside world to keep the testbench accurate.

**`expose`**: Registers expressions that need to be exposed as module outputs, handling different types (expr, array, fifo, trigger). The collected metadata ultimately drives both module-level port declarations and the top-level harness wiring.

**`get_pred`**: Generates the current execution predicate by combining all conditions in the condition stack

**`get_external_port_name`**: Creates mangled port names for external values to avoid naming conflicts

#### Internal Helpers

**`_walk_expressions`**: Recursively traverses blocks to find all expressions for analysis

**`_generate_external_module_wrapper`**: Creates PyCDE wrapper classes for external SystemVerilog modules. If the external metadata defines explicit wires (and their direction), the wrapper mirrors them; otherwise it falls back to treating the declared ports as inputs for backwards compatibility. Clock/reset ports are emitted when requested by the metadata.

**`_connect_array`**: Handles multi-port array connections between modules by wiring each moduleâ€™s per-port write enable/data/index signals into the shared array writer instance the dumper previously generated.

**`_is_external_module`**: Determines if a module represents an external implementation
