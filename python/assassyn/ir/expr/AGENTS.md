`intrinsic.py` is special, as these intrinsics are meaningless without
understanding the global view of our whole system.
To avoid redundancy and the excessive consistency across different
files, all the intrinsics documentation can be omitted
and replaced by "Refer to [the design doc of intrinsics](../../../../docs/design/lang/intrinsics.md)".
