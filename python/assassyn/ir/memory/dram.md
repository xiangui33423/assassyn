## Summary

This module implements DRAM (Dynamic Random Access Memory) simulation for Assassyn's IR. Unlike SRAM, DRAM operates as an off-chip memory module that interacts with the on-chip pipeline through asynchronous request/response mechanisms. The module extends `MemoryBase` to provide DRAM-specific functionality using intrinsic functions for memory request handling, as described in the [intrinsics documentation](../expr/intrinsic.md).

## Exposed Interfaces

### `class DRAM`

DRAM memory module that extends MemoryBase for off-chip memory simulation.

**Purpose:** This class simulates an off-chip DRAM module that communicates with the on-chip pipeline through asynchronous memory requests. Unlike SRAM which provides immediate data access, DRAM requires request/response cycles and may have variable latency.

**Inheritance:** Extends `MemoryBase` from [base.py](./base.py)

### `def __init__(self, width: int, depth: int, init_file: str | None)`

Initialize DRAM module with the same interface as MemoryBase.

**Parameters:**
- `width: int` - Width of memory in bits (must be positive integer)
- `depth: int` - Depth of memory in words (must be positive integer and power of 2)
- `init_file: str | None` - Path to initialization file for simulation (can be None)

**Returns:** None

**Explanation:**
This constructor delegates to the parent `MemoryBase.__init__()` method, inheriting all the base memory functionality including parameter validation, address width calculation, and payload array creation. No DRAM-specific initialization is required at construction time.

### `def build(self, we, re, addr, wdata)`

Build the DRAM module with combinational logic for memory request handling.

**Parameters:**
- `we: Value` - Write enable signal
- `re: Value` - Read enable signal  
- `addr: Value` - Address signal
- `wdata: Value` - Write data signal

**Returns:** `(read_succ, write_succ)` - Tuple of boolean values indicating request success

**Explanation:**
This method implements the core DRAM functionality using the `@combinational` decorator from [downstream.py](../module/downstream.md). Unlike SRAM which provides immediate data access, DRAM uses asynchronous request/response patterns:

1. **Signal Assignment:** All input signals are stored as instance attributes for use by the memory system
2. **Read Request:** When `re` is enabled, calls `send_read_request(self, re, addr)` from [intrinsic.py](../expr/intrinsic.md) to initiate an asynchronous read operation
3. **Write Request:** When `we` is enabled, calls `send_write_request(self, we, addr, wdata)` to initiate an asynchronous write operation
4. **Success Indication:** Returns boolean values indicating whether each request was successfully sent

**Note on Parameter Order:** The intrinsic functions use the parameter order `(self, enable, addr)` for read requests and `(self, enable, addr, data)` for write requests. This differs from some documentation that may show `(self, addr, enable)` - the implementation order is authoritative.

**DRAM Integration with Ramulator2:** The DRAM module integrates with the Ramulator2 simulation backend through intrinsic functions:
- **Request Handling**: Intrinsic functions interface with the Ramulator2 C++ library for realistic DRAM simulation
- **Response Management**: Memory responses are handled through the intrinsic response system
- **Callback Integration**: DRAM callbacks are managed through the simulator code generation system

The success signals allow downstream modules to determine if requests need to be retried. This follows the asynchronous memory access pattern described in [arch.md](../../../docs/design/arch/arch.md) where memory operations may have variable latency and require proper flow control.

**Technical Details:**
- Uses intrinsic functions `send_read_request` and `send_write_request` for memory system integration
- Requests are only sent when the corresponding enable signal is asserted
- Success/failure indication enables proper error handling and retry logic
- Follows the combinational downstream module pattern for same-cycle signal processing

## Internal Helpers

### `def __repr__(self)`

Provide string representation for debugging.

**Returns:** `str` - String representation with module type identifier

**Explanation:**
Returns a debug-friendly string representation using the internal `_repr_impl()` method with the identifier 'memory.DRAM' for clear module identification in logs and debugging output.

## Performance Characteristics

**DRAM Module Performance Notes:**
- **Latency**: Variable latency depending on memory state and access patterns
- **Throughput**: Lower throughput compared to SRAM due to request/response cycles
- **Resource Usage**: Lower hardware resource usage compared to SRAM
- **Power Consumption**: Lower power consumption compared to SRAM due to dynamic operation
- **Timing Constraints**: Variable timing requires proper flow control and retry mechanisms
- **Access Patterns**: Optimized for sequential access patterns with burst operations
