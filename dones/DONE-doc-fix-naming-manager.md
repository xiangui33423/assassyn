   - Added proper function signatures in code blocks for all methods
   - Moved internal helper methods to the appropriate section

2. **Enhanced Function Documentation:**
   - Added detailed explanations for each function with references to their usage locations in the codebase
   - Documented the interaction with AST rewriting system through `rewrite_assign.py`
   - Explained the integration with the global `Singleton.builder` system
   - Added references to related modules like `ir/array.py`, `ir/module/module.py`, and `experimental/frontend/factory.py`

3. **Improved Context Documentation:**
   - Maintained the context-aware array naming section with clearer formatting
   - Added explanations for the semantic name attribute `__assassyn_semantic_name__`
   - Documented the error handling strategy and silent failure patterns

4. **Code Analysis:**
   - Analyzed function usages across the codebase to understand behavior patterns
   - Identified key integration points with other modules
   - Documented the global state management approach
