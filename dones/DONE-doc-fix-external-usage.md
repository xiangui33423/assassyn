# DONE: Documentation Fix for External Usage Analysis

## Summary

Successfully completed documentation review and creation for `analysis/external_usage.py` → `analysis/external_usage.md` according to the new documentation standards.

## Changes Made

### 1. Created New Documentation File

**File**: `python/assassyn/analysis/external_usage.md`

**Structure**: Organized according to new standards with:
- **Section 1. Exposed Interfaces**: Documented both `get_module()` and `expr_externally_used()` functions
- **Section 2. Internal Helpers**: Noted that no internal helpers exist
- **Usage Context**: Explained integration with code generation
- **Dependencies**: Listed required IR components
- **Technical Notes**: Described underlying IR relationships

### 2. Function Documentation

**`get_module(operand: Operand) -> Module`**:
- Documented parameter types and return value
- Explained behavior for different operand user types
- Clarified when `None` is returned

**`expr_externally_used(expr: Expr, exclude_push: bool) -> bool`**:
- Documented cross-module usage analysis
- Explained the `exclude_push` parameter behavior
- Described the algorithm for detecting external usage

### 3. Usage Analysis

**Code Generation Integration**:
- Identified usage in `codegen/simulator/modules.py` for simulator code generation
- Identified usage in `codegen/verilog/design.py` for Verilog code generation
- Documented the role in determining module interface requirements

### 4. Updated Documentation Status

**File**: `todos/DOCUMENTATION-STATUS.md`
- Moved `analysis/external_usage.py` from "TO CHECK" to "DONE" section
- Updated statistics: 44 → 43 files to check, 1 → 2 files completed
- Updated progress percentages accordingly

## Quality Assurance

- ✅ Functions are well-implemented and consistent with their names
- ✅ No semantic changes were needed
- ✅ Documentation follows new standards with proper sections
- ✅ Usage patterns analyzed across the codebase
- ✅ Dependencies and technical context documented

## Files Modified

1. `python/assassyn/analysis/external_usage.md` (created)
2. `todos/DOCUMENTATION-STATUS.md` (updated)
3. `todos/TODO-doc-fix-external-usage.md` (created for follow-up items)
