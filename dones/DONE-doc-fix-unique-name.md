## Summary

Successfully reviewed and updated the documentation for `builder/unique_name.py` to comply with the new documentation standards.

## Changes Made

### Documentation Restructuring

- **Reorganized structure**: Transformed the brief documentation into the required format with "Section 1. Exposed Interfaces" and "Section 2. Internal Helpers"
- **Enhanced descriptions**: Added comprehensive explanations for each method, including parameters, return values, and behavioral details
- **Added context**: Included information about the module's role in the Assassyn naming system and its integration with other components
- **Improved formatting**: Applied consistent formatting with proper code blocks and structured sections

### Content Improvements

- **Detailed method documentation**: Enhanced `__init__` and `get_unique_name` method descriptions with clear explanations of their behavior
- **Usage context**: Added references to related modules (`TypeOrientedNamer` and `NamingManager`) to provide better understanding of the component's role
- **Integration section**: Added a new section explaining how the cache fits into the broader naming system

## Files Modified

- `python/assassyn/builder/unique_name.md`: Complete restructuring and enhancement of documentation

## Verification
