# Rust Simulator Dumper

This document overviews the structure of Rust simulator coordination,
which is generated by [simulator.py](../../python/assassyn/codegen/simulator/simulator.py).

For architectural context and execution model, see [arch.md](../arch/arch.md).
For Verilog pipeline generation, see [pipeline.md](./pipeline.md).
For module generation, see [module.md](./module.md).

## Header

```rust
// use sim_runtime::libloading::os::unix::{Library, Symbol, RTLD_GLOBAL, RTLD_LAZY};
use sim_runtime::num_bigint::{BigInt, BigUint};
use sim_runtime::rand::seq::SliceRandom;
use sim_runtime::*;
use std::collections::HashMap;
use std::collections::VecDeque;
use std::sync::Arc;
```

To reduce the redundant compilation, all the external libraries are re-exported in
[sim_runtime](../../../../tools/rust-sim-runtime/) crate.

Platform-specific library loading is now handled automatically through the
`MemoryInterface::new_from_cwrapper_path()` method, which reads library paths
from files generated by CMake. This eliminates the need for platform-specific
imports and manual path construction.

## Simulator Context Fields

```rust
pub struct Simulator {
  pub stamp: usize,
  /* RegArray's */
  /* Stage Bookkeeping */
  /* Exposed Values */
  /* DRAM Interface */
}

impl Simulator {
  pub fn new() -> Self {
    Simulator {
      stamp: 0,
      /* Reg Array's initialization */
      /* Module bookkeeping initialization */
      /* Values exposed to external modules. */
      /* DRAM Interface */
    }
  }
}
```

### Common Fields

The simulator context contains a global time `stamp`, to record the current cycle
of simulation. The time `stamp` is incremented by 25, 25, 50 in each cycle, to simulate
pipeline stage module, downstream module, and register arrays, respectively, and then
move to the next cycle. See below for more details.

### Register Arrays

Our code generator traverses all arrays in the system to gather all their identifiers, types,
and initial values to fill in the `Simulator` fields, and the constructor, `new()`, function.
Each array is instantiated as a `Array<T>` struct defined in `sim_runtime` crate, which
includes its data payload, and associated methods to write.

### Module Bookkeeping

As per [module](../../ir/module/), we have two kinds of modules, [pipeline stage module](../../ir/module/module.py),
and [downstream module](../../ir/module/downstream.py) driven by pipeline stages.

For each module, several field appended to the `Simulator` struct:

- A boolean flag named `<module_name>_triggered: bool` to indicate whether the module is properly triggered in the current cycle.
  A properly triggered module returns true to the `simulator` host, and the host will pop the front event in the event queue.
  If the module has a `wait_until` intrinsic, and the wait condition is not satisfied, the module returns `false`.

Additionally, each pipeline stage module has:

- An event queue named `<module_name>_event: Vec<usize>` to store the time stamps when the module is asynchronously triggered.
- Stage ports are instantiated as `FIFO<T>` defined in `sim_runtime` crate, named `<module_name>_<port_name>`.
  Port FIFOs are more general stage registers, which can buffer multiple ongoing data.

> These fields are flattened in the `Simulator` struct, instead of being grouped in a sub-struct, for easier access and management.
  As modules may access FIFOs of other modules to asynchronously trigger each other, grouping them in sub-structs would complicate
  the access patterns.

### Exposed Values

For each value externally referenced in a `Downstream` module, we expose it as a field in the `Simulator` struct.
This value is `<module_name>_<value_name>: Option<type> field. This value will be reset to `None` at the beginning
of each cycle, and the code path to which this value belongs will set it to `Some(value)` when the value is produced.
See below for more details on resetting each cycle.
See [per module generation](./modules.py) for more details on value generation.

### DRAM Simulation

Each [DRAM](../../ir/memory/dram.py) instantiated should have a corresponding `MemoryInterface`
to invoke [Ramulator2 Rust Wrapper](../../../../tools/rust-sim-runtime/src/ramulator2.md)
to send and receive requests. Each `MemoryInterface` instance is named `mi_<dram_module>`.
Associated with each `MemoryInterface`, we have an additional 
`<dram_module>_response: Response` field to buffer the result of memory responses,
including read and write. This replaces the previous single global memory interface approach
with per-DRAM-module interfaces for better isolation and callback management.

## Simulator Methods

### Common Methods

The simulator helper methods to manage the simulation.

```rust
  // \param event: The event queue of the module.
  fn event_valid(&self, event: &VecDeque<usize>) -> bool;
```

This method accepts an event queue of a module, `i.e. <module_name>_event`, and checks if the front event
time stamp is smaller the current global time stamp, `self.stamp`. If so, the module is eligible to be triggered.

--------

```rust
  pub fn reset_downstream(&mut self);
```

- As downstreams accept purely combinational logic, all their values are volatile, so all the values in the exposed
  value shall be reset to `None` at the beginning of each cycle by this function.
- As downstreams are driven by upper stream pipeline stages, if a downstream is triggered is determined by
  its upstream stage triggers. Thus, all the `<module_name>_triggered` flags are reset to `false` at the beginning of each cycle.

--------

````rust
  pub fn tick_memory(&mut self);
````
This function calls `sim.mi_<mem>.frontend_tick();` and `sim.mi_<mem>.memory_system_tick();`
for each DRAM module.


--------

```rust
  pub fn tick_registers(&mut self);
```

All the register arrays are edge-triggered in hardware. To simulate this behavior, we adopt a half "cycle tick" mechanism.
After simulating all the pipeline stage modules, we increment the global time stamp by 25.
Then we simulate all the downstream modules, and increment the global time stamp by another 25.
At this "half cycle", we tick all the registers to commit the writes to the registers.
It calls the `tick` method of each `Array<T>` instance with the current "half cycle" time stamp.

--------

```rust
  pub fn reset_dram(&mut self);
```
At the end of each cycle, it resets the status of each DRAM response.
By setting `sim.<dram>_response`'s `valid`, `write_succ`, and `read_succ` to `false`.

### Per Module Invoker

For each module, a `simulate_<module_name>` function is generated to invoke the module simulation kernel
generated by [per module generation](./modules.py).
Each module simulation kernel is named `<module_name>` function in `modules` sub-module.

For pipeline stage modules, the simulation checks if the module has an event earlier than the current time stamp.
If so, it invokes the module simulation kernel. The simulation kernel returns a boolean flag to indicate
whether the module is properly triggered. If proper, the front event in the event queue is popped,
and the `<module_name>_triggered` flag is set to `true`.

```rust
  fn simulate_<module_name>(&mut self) {
    if self.event_valid(&self.<module_name>_event) {
      let succ = super::modules::<module_name>(self);
      if succ {
        self.<module_name>_event.pop_front();
      } else {
        self.<exposed>_value = None;
      } // close if
      self.<module_name>_triggered = succ;
    } // close event
  } // close function
```

For downstream modules, as they are driven by upstream pipeline stages,
it checks if any of its upstream modules is triggered in the current cycle.
If so, it invokes the module simulation kernel.

```rust
  fn simulate_<downstream_name>(&mut self) {
    if <upstream_module1>_triggered || <upstream_module2>_triggered || ... {
      let succ = super::modules::<module_name>(self);
      self.<module_name>_triggered = succ;
    } else {
      self.<exposed>_value = None;
    } // close if
  } // close function
```

Further, `upstream` can either be a pipeline stage module, or another downstream module,
as downstream modules can be chained.

Also, if either a pipeline stage module or downstream module is not triggered in the current cycle,
their exposed values are set to `None`.

## Simulator Host

The simulator host function, `simulate()`, is the entry point of the simulator.
The function:
1. instantiates a `Simulator` instance, initializes the memory interface with the given configuration file path.

```rust
pub fn simulate() {
  let mut sim = Simulator::new();

  unsafe {
    sim
      .mem_interface
      .init("/path/to/example_config.yaml");
  }
```

2. gathers all the pipeline stage module invokers put them in a vector, `simulators`.
   - Pipeline stages are fully concurrent, so the order of invoking them does not matter.
   - TODO: Make this multi-threaded in the future.

```rust
  let simulators: Vec<fn(&mut Simulator)> = vec![ /* simulate_<module> */ ];
```

3. gathers all the downstream module invokers put them in a vector, `downstreams`.
   - Note: Because downstream modules are purely combinational, there should be a topological order among them.
     We have `topo_downstream_modules` in [analysis](../../analysis/topo.py) implemented.

```rust
  let downstreams: Vec<fn(&mut Simulator)> = vec![ /* simulate_<downstream> */];
```

4. pushes events to `driver` module to kick off the simulation, and set `idle_count` to 0.
  - The number of events is from `config['sim_threshold']`.
  - The idle count is from `config['idle_threshold']`.
   - Then it initializes testbench specific events by finding `Testbench` module, and works on all it cycled-blocks.
     - All the cycled-blocks' (as declared in [block.py](../../ir/block.py)) corresponding cycle will be pushed to the event queue of `Testbench` module.

```rust
  for i in 1..=/* sim_threshold */ {
    sim.Driver_event.push_back(i * 100);
  }
  /* Testbench event initialization */
  let mut idle_count = 0;
```

1. runs the simulation loop until reaching the cycle limit, or idle threshold. In each cycle:
   - The simulation granularity is at half cycles, so we time the current cycle by 100, to have a fixed point fraction.
   - Then it resets all the downstream exposed values to `None`, and all the `<module_name>_triggered` flags to `false`.
   - Then it invokes all the pipeline stage module invokers in `simulators`.
   - Then it invokes all the downstream module invokers in `downstreams`.
   - Then it initializes all the SRAMs from files if needed, by invoking `load_hex_file` from `sim_runtime`.
     - TODO: Make SRAM a subclass of Downstream and make all SRAM payload initialization RegArray initialization.
   - Then it checks if any module is triggered in this cycle. If not, it increments an `idle_count`.
     If `idle_count` reaches a threshold, e.g., 200, the simulation stops.
     If any module is triggered, `idle_count` is reset to 0.
   - Then it increments the global time stamp by 50 to simulate register arrays, and ticks all the registers.
   - Finally, it ticks the memory interface.

```rust
  for i in 1..=200 {
    sim.stamp = i * 100;
    sim.reset_downstream();
    sim.tick_memory();

    for simulate in simulators.iter() {
      simulate(&mut sim);
    }

    for simulate in downstreams.iter() {
      simulate(&mut sim);
    }

    /* Initialize all the SRAM */

    let any_module_triggered = /* check all <module_name>_triggered flags */ ;

    // Handle idle threshold
    if !any_module_triggered {
      idle_count += 1;
      if idle_count >= /* idle_threshold */ {
        println!("Simulation stopped due to reaching idle threshold of 200");
        break;
      }
    } else {
      idle_count = 0;
    }

    sim.stamp += 50;
    sim.tick_registers();
    sim.reset_dram();
    unsafe {
    }
  }
}
```
