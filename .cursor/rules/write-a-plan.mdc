description: Make a plan for all modifications to the code base

When you are asked to make a plan, such a plan should follow these rules:

0. The order of a plan matters:
   - Test-driven development is prefered. Thus, it is preferred to develop the test cases before the features.
   - Documents should be updated before the feature, so that your trace of thinking is fixed their as a reference.
      - Think carefully and deeply before doing any code modification. Follow our good code standard.
   - It is OK to update the documents when you realize there is some issue for the design itself afterward.
1. Make intermediate commits to have your half-way result commited.
   - If you are screwed you can also roll back more easily.
   - You should CAREFULLY consider, which intermediate commit should be checked, and which need not.
     - For example, when adding new test cases for a new feature, you should run the test first to make sure it fails as expected. Then, you should commit with `--no-verify`.
     - However, when finalizing a plan, you should always commit with pre-commit check.
2. Read the [good code standard](./write-good-code.mdc) to make your own decision of refactoring good code without changing the semantics.
3. When finalizing your changes, always trigger a `pre-commit` test to make sure you modifications are good.
   - If you have on-going changes, just stage and commit as per [commit message standard](./git-message.mdc).
   - If you already committed everything, use `git commit --no-edit --amend` to trigger it again!
4. Leave a summary document in `dones/DONE-xxx.md`, where `xxx` briefly summarizes the title of the plan.
   - If this folder does not exist, create `dones/`.
   - This should include:
     1. Briefly discuss your achievements in this plan;
        - If it is a feature, briefly talk about the usage.
        - If it is a bug, refer to the test case that replicates the bug.
        - If it is a code base improvement, summarize the benefit of it.
        - If it is not covered above, leave a summary for me to update this rule.
     2. Based on your understandings suggest several further improvoments related to this plan;
     3. Discuss the non-obivious technical insights and decisions you made;
        - These decisions and insights should be left in the code comments too.
        - If you did not do it, do it now, and re-stage-and-commit it.
   - Stage and commit this summary document.
