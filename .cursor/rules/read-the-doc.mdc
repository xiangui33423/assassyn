## Read Document

When asked to modify a module or document,
incorporate the descriptions in the documents for better understandings.
Especially, remember to recursively read all the documents in `docs/design/*.md`
to learn the project-specific knowledge, including but
not limited to:
1. The purpose of this project;
2. The design decisions of core modules.
