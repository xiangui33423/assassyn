## Read Document

When asked to modify a module or document, incorporate the descriptions in the documents for better understandings.

When it comes to a specific design and implementation in a source code, within the same folder,
there should be a `*.md` file with the same name that documents this source code.
Read that to gain more insights.

Also, remember to recursively read all the documents in `docs/design/*.md`
to learn the project-specific knowledge, including but not limited to:
1. The purpose of this project;
2. The design decisions of core modules.
3. Other high-level knowledge of this project.
