description: How to move, remove, rename, and create files
---

Applying move, removal, renaming, and creation to a source code file is trivial,
as it is enforced by the compiler, which will finally be iterated
into a correct format.

When it gets involved with document files `*.md`, things become tricky,
as there is no formal enforcement like compilation to gaurantee the 
process. After applying such operations mentioned above to a file,
no matter, source or document, we should do the followings to 
maintain the consistency across documents and source codes:

1. Before changing the file, use `grep` at the root of this repository with
   this file name and and its associated file (for a document it is a source,
   for a source it is a document, vice versa) to find all the related usages.
   A path usage to this can either be:
   1. a relative path in markdown link, `[text](./relative/path/from/this/file)`,
   2. a absolute path in this project `assassyn/path/to/file`.
2. Match the file paths pointing to this file and make changes to them to the new path.
  - If it is a removal, remove their usage. Make sure the code is deprecated.
  - If it is a rename, change to the new paths.
  - If it is a creation, make sure those related files mention to it.
3. Apply the changes to the new destination, including removal, renaming, and creation.
