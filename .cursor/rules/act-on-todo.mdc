# Developer Flow

This document outlines the flow both a human and an agentic AI developer shall follow to
add new features, fix bugs, and improve the codebase.

## 1. Understand the Goal

If a `TODO-xxx.md` is given look at the `Goal or Issue` section in the `TODO-xxx.md` file.
Make sure you understand what needs to be done. If not, developer should clearly state
the requirement.

## 2. Analyze the Current State

It is supposed that all the design documents are updated to the desired state, but the
code is still lagging when `TODO-xxx.md` is received.
Review the design documents and incorperate the action items into
your understanding of the codebase. In other words, if there is a discrepency
between code and document, respect the document, and make the code as
the document described.

## 3. Act on Action Items

If a TODO is given, follow the action items in it step by step. Faithfully implement the changes
and improvements as described in the action items.
Faithfully use `git commit` with or without `--no-verify` flag as described in the action items.

## 4. Checklist & Summary

After all action items are down, a summary checklist should be appended after the `TODO-xxx.md` file.
No matter if a TODO is given write a report in `dones/DONE-xxx.md` where `xxx` is the same as `TODO-xxx`,
or summarize what you did this time.
  - If `dones` folder does not exist, create it.
  - `dones` foleder is already in `.gitignore`, so `DONE-xxx.md` should not be committed.

The summary should include four parts:
0. The goal achieved as per the TODO or user's requirement.
1. All the action items you achieved as a checklist.
2. All the changes made in the codebase, including:
   - Improvements made: Some minor refactor that is be done along with this commit.
   - Some interfaces you created that are not documented.
   - If an interface refactor happens more than 3 times, present a representative simple before-after code snippet.
      - No need to present code snippets in other cases.
3. Summarize the non-obvious technical decisions made during the implementation. This includes but is not limited to:
   - For example, if it is a short-term hack, explain this hack and suggest a fundamental solution.
   - If a workaround for a bug in test case before this TODO, explain it and suggest a fundamental solution.
   - If a test case is skipped, explain why and suggest a plan to unskip it.
   - If an external dependency does not fulfill our need, explain why and suggest a plan to replace it.

Remember to keep it precise, state the fact itself more, and use less adjacents and adverb to decorate.

After making all these changes above, if:
- There are unstaged changes, stage and commit all the changes as per our git commit message guideline, WITHOUT bypassing pre-commit!
- There are no unstaged changes, use `git commit --no-edit --amend` to trigger pre-commit once!
- If some of the test cases do not work, you can still commit it. However, you should comprehensively document it in the DONE document:
  1. What are the test cases and what are the error behavior?
  2. Do you have any suggestions on how to fix it?
  3. Do you have any insights on what causes this issue?
  4. What are the efforts you made to this?
  5. When finalizing a TODO, you **CANNOT** bypass the `pre-commit` check using `--no-verify`.
  6. If not specified at the beginning of the given plan, there is NO PRE-EXISTING test failure. DO NOT use that as an excuse to bypass the tests when finalizing! You should make sure that your changes DO NOT break any thing!
