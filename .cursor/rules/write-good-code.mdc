# Write Good Code

This document discusses several key rules of writing good code:

1. When introducing a new wrapper like below, ask yourself do we really need such an indirection.
   - These indirections including, but not limited to struct/class wrappers, and function wrappers.
   - If you do a wrapper like below, carefully think if it is it because we designed a poor interface. before.
```python
def foo_wrapper(a):
    foo(a, 0)
```
   - Do NOT even try to write a wrapper like below, which is totally redundant!
```python
def _foo_wrapper(a):
   a.foo()

class A:
   a: int
   b: int

class AWrapper:
   wrapped_a: int
   wrapped_b: int

a = A()
wrapper = AWrapper(a)
```

2. When writing a set of repeat code, consider to refine a unified interface. If you write a repeat code
   twice, you have a chance to write it more times. If similar code is distributed everywhere, you need
   to modify it everywhere, which not only worsens the readability but also lengthens the contexts.
   - However, focus on one thing at a time. If you realize it is a over engineering, report it in the summary.

3. Focus on thing for each module. If a module is originally designed for a purpose, do not borrow its code
   path for anything else, unless the addition is a part of feature extension closely related to this module.
   - Do not reinvent infrastructures! If you need a handy helper for some usage. First check if
     this is already available in the related data structures' member methods, and find if it is available
     in `python/assassyn/analysis` and `python/assassyn/utils`.
   - If not, carefully differentiate your requirements! If this is a common usage missing in the corresponding
     struct, bravely add it! If this is a usage only limited to the module you are developing, keep this helper
     private to this function!
   - If it is an IR-wise analysis and operation, use the visitor-pattern base class implemented in
     `python/assassyn/ir/visitor.py`.

4. DO NOT excessively try catch. Carefully inspect the data structure you are working on!
   Even in some managed language with very flexible meta programming manipulation, it is not preferred to use
   such language feature as it is error-prone!
   - Every time, if you used try-catch, carefully think if you are making too conservative assumption on the code!
   - If you want to access a member, `setattr` and `getattr` in Python are NOT preferred!
     If it causes an error, carefully inspect if you are accessing a correct attribute first!
   - All the Python class, if possible, should declare their members and types at the beginning of each type using
     the similar style below:
```python
class Coord:
   x: float
   y: float
```

5. DO NOT hard code. If you have a constant value defined for a specific purpose, when used do not hard code
   its literal value. Is is possible to:
     - Make this value a constant variable and use this variable?
     - Change it to a enum to avoid other mistakes?

6. Low invasion. Every time you make a mofication, carefully control the files are affective.
   Unless you are sure you are told to do an interface refactor, make sure all the modifications
   should be inside the module and the interface exposed by the module.
