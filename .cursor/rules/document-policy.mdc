# Documentation

## Naming Correspondence

Each source code file, including but not limited to `.py/.rs/.cpp/.cc`,
shall have a `.md` file with the same prefix, in the same folder.
If needed, read that file to have a deeper understanding of the
current implementation. Also, we asked to modify the code,
include the document updates!

If there is a `README.md` within a folder, and there
is `mod.rs` or `__init__.py` in this folder, these
modules SHOULD NOT be documented by `README.md`.
They should have their own `mod.md` and `__init__.md`
to maintain a consistent naming correspondence.
But still, it is not recommended to implement anything in
these package initialization. These source units should only
expose functions to external modules.

## Document File Structure

It is mandatory to have a `README.md` in each folder to briefly summarize
the file structure within this folder, including the functionality
of each file in this folder, as well as the immediate sub-folder.

## Document Source Code

When documenting a source code, such a document should be separated into
the following sections.

### Section 0. Summary

Before documenting any interfaces, a brief summary is optional.
If the documented module highly relies on project-specific knowledge,
or the whole module is achieving one thing, this shall be briefly summarized
in this section.

### Section 1. Exposed Interfaces

This section shall describe all the function interfaces and data structures in this source file unit
that are exposed to the usage for other parts of the project.
All the functions and data structures documented should follow the
[function](#document-functions) and [document](#document-structs) conventions discussed below.

### Section 2. Internal Helpers

To keep the complexity of the implementation of each exposed interface, internal helper functions and structs shall be developed.
These internal helpers' visibility is limited in a scope. This section shall describe all the function interfaces and
data structures that are implemented in this source code unit. All funcitons and data structures
shall follow the [function](#document-functions) and [document](#document-structs) conventions discussed below.

### Document Structs

Each struct should have its own subsection, this subsection should describe
- the purpose of each `struct/class`.
- the meaning of each member field, and static member field.

Each struct should have a subsection under this section named `struct StructID` to document.
All the function memthod members should be included in this subsection, and 
follow the [function documentation convention below](#document-functions).

### Document Functions

Each function should have its own identifier, without parameters, as the section name.

This section starts with the function signature with
language-embedded documents For example, Rust uses `///`,
it is favored to use `Doxygen` style for C/C++,
and Python has `'''` pair for docstring. These documents briefs
the API behavior and each parameter, as well as the return (if any),
like below:

```python
def foo(a, b):
  '''
  Briefly talk about the behavior here

  @param a The first parameter
  @param b The 2nd parameter
  @return If any, explain it.
  '''
```

A rule of thumb is that minimize the ambiguity of each aspect
you document. For example, for `subprocess.check_output` in Python:
- DO NOT SAY: "It returns the output of the subprocess" where output can be anything, even the return value.
- SAY: "It returns the subprocess output to stdout." which is more specific.

Different rules are imposed on functions with different levels of complexity. To determine:
1. A function is considered simple, if:
   - This function is a short (< 5 lines) helper, or
   - this function only depends on its input to produce the output, and the behavior
     can be summarized accurately and briefly. No specific design decisions, definitions,
     or complicated interfaces exposed by other source units witin this project
     are required to understand and develop this function.
     - For example, a function that "sums up the norm the two given vectors, and normalize
       the result vector length", which cannot be implemented in 5 lines, but it requires
       no knowledge specific to this project.
   - A wrapper function is special, a wrapper function can call a very complicated
     interface outside this project unit, but it is still considered as simple.
     It should document:
       - The location of the external function.
       - The purpose of wrapping, e.g. foreign function interface? providing a unified
         function signature? or legacy management?
2. If a function is complicated, because either:
   - It is long with multiple steps to achieve a goal. In this case, each step should
     be carefully elaborated.
   - Its implementation involves several project-specific high-level view, design decision
     and other related knowledge. To gain such knowledge of this project, and determine
     if this function requires them, refer to [reading document](#read-document) section
     for more details. If such knowledge is involved when developing this function,
     such knowledge should refer to the document it was initially discussed.
   - No matter how many lines, if a function acts on a global variable declared outside
     this source unit, we should pay extra attention to it. It is inevitable to track some
     global states across the project, and for development experience purpose they are implicitly
     referred singletons. A pointer to that file of declaration should be added, especially from the `docs/design/*.md`.

A simple function can be simply documented by the function signature and documentation
strings embbed in comments. In addition to what simple functions already have, complicated
functions should be followed by **Explanation** paragraph to explain
1. Each step of the function;
2. The project-specific knowledge required to understand this function, and point to the document;
3. When it comes to 2, TRY YOUR VERY BEST to find the specific file that documents
   the knowledge or the source unit implements the function it relies on,
   and put a Markdown link, `[knowledge](/lint/to/it)`, for it;
4. Dirty details that this function trying to handle;
5. Technical decisions made by this function.

## Best Practice

To maintain a LLM context friendly document length,
if possible, keep the document length around 300-500 lines.
It is acceptable to have a document up to 800 lines.
If a document is more than 500 lines, leave a `TODO-breakdown-module-xxx.md`
file for human intervention.
