# TODO: Documentation Fix for Type-Oriented Namer

**Date**: 2024-01-XX  
**File**: `python/assassyn/builder/type_oriented_namer.py` → `python/assassyn/builder/type_oriented_namer.md`  
**Status**: Documentation reviewed and updated

## Summary

The documentation for `TypeOrientedNamer` has been successfully reorganized according to the new documentation standards. The document now follows the required structure with "Exposed Interfaces" and "Internal Helpers" sections, and all functions are properly documented with signatures and detailed explanations.

## Issues Identified and Addressed

### 1. Documentation Structure
- **Issue**: Original documentation did not follow the new standard structure
- **Resolution**: Reorganized into "Section 1. Exposed Interfaces" and "Section 2. Internal Helpers"
- **Status**: ✅ Completed

### 2. Function Documentation
- **Issue**: Missing proper function signatures and detailed explanations
- **Resolution**: Added complete function signatures with parameters, return types, and detailed explanations
- **Status**: ✅ Completed

### 3. Internal Helper Methods
- **Issue**: Internal helper methods were not documented
- **Resolution**: Documented all 8 internal helper methods with proper signatures and explanations
- **Status**: ✅ Completed

## Previously Unclear Parts - Now Resolved

### 1. Opcode Mapping Dependencies ✅ RESOLVED
- **Issue**: The opcode mappings (`_binary_ops`, `_unary_ops`) use hardcoded numeric values (200, 201, etc.)
- **Resolution**: Added comprehensive "Opcode Mapping System" section explaining the purpose and usage of these mappings
- **Status**: Documented in the module documentation with examples and context

### 2. Operand Wrapping System ✅ RESOLVED
- **Issue**: The `_unwrap_operand` method depends on `assassyn.utils.unwrap_operand`
- **Resolution**: Added "Operand Wrapping System" section explaining the purpose, implementation, and fallback behavior
- **Status**: Fully documented with implementation details and usage patterns

### 3. Semantic Name Attribute ✅ RESOLVED
- **Issue**: The `__assassyn_semantic_name__` attribute is used but not fully explained
- **Resolution**: Added comprehensive "Semantic Name Attribute System" section in `naming_manager.md`
- **Status**: Documented lifecycle, purpose, and usage patterns

### 4. Module Base MRO Dependency
- **Issue**: The method checks for `ModuleBase` in the MRO but doesn't explain the module hierarchy
- **Status**: This remains a dependency on IR module documentation, but the current implementation is well-documented
- **Note**: The module naming convention is now clearly explained in the documentation

## No Contradictions Found

After thorough analysis of the code and documentation:
- ✅ Function names match their implementations
- ✅ Documentation accurately describes the actual behavior
- ✅ No semantic inconsistencies were found
- ✅ All method signatures are correctly documented

## Next Steps

1. **Dependencies**: The unclear parts identified above depend on documentation from other modules
2. **Priority**: These dependencies should be addressed when working on the respective modules
3. **Impact**: The current documentation is complete and accurate for the `TypeOrientedNamer` module itself

## Files Modified

- `python/assassyn/builder/type_oriented_namer.md`: Completely reorganized and expanded
