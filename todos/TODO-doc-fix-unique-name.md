# TODO: Documentation Review for UniqueNameCache

## Section 1: Goal

Review and update the documentation for `builder/unique_name.py` to comply with the new documentation standards, ensuring it follows the required structure with "Exposed Interfaces" and "Internal Helpers" sections.

## Section 2: Action Items

### Documentation Development

- [x] **Review existing documentation structure**: The original documentation was brief and did not follow the new standards requiring "Exposed Interfaces" and "Internal Helpers" sections.

- [x] **Analyze usage patterns**: Examined how `UniqueNameCache` is used throughout the codebase by `TypeOrientedNamer` and `NamingManager` to understand its role in the naming system.

- [x] **Check for inconsistencies**: Verified that the documentation accurately reflects the implementation and found no contradictions.

- [x] **Reorganize documentation**: Restructured the documentation to follow the new standards with proper sections and detailed explanations.

### Findings

**No unclear parts or inconsistencies found**: The `UniqueNameCache` implementation is straightforward and well-documented. The class has a simple interface with clear behavior:
- `__init__()` initializes an empty cache dictionary
- `get_unique_name(prefix)` returns the prefix on first use, then adds numbered suffixes

**No project-specific dependencies require clarification**: The class is self-contained and its usage patterns are clearly documented in the related `TypeOrientedNamer` and `NamingManager` documentation.

**No contradictions between documentation and implementation**: The behavior described in the documentation matches the actual implementation exactly.

## Conclusion

The documentation review for `UniqueNameCache` is complete. The module has been successfully updated to comply with the new documentation standards without requiring any additional clarification or fixes.

## Additional Improvements Made

- **Cross-reference consistency**: Verified that all references to other modules use correct `.md` extensions
- **Integration clarity**: Enhanced explanations of how `UniqueNameCache` integrates with the broader naming system
- **Usage patterns**: Clarified the role of the cache in both `TypeOrientedNamer` and `NamingManager`
