# TODO: Documentation Review for Naming Manager

## Section 1: Goal

Review and update the documentation for `builder/naming_manager.py` to comply with the new documentation standards, ensuring all functions are properly documented with their behavior, dependencies, and usage patterns.

## Section 2: Action Items

### Document Development

- **Document Review Completed:** The documentation for `naming_manager.py` has been reorganized according to the new standards with proper sections for exposed interfaces and internal helpers. All functions now have detailed explanations with references to their usage in the codebase.

### Coding Development

- **Documentation Reorganization Completed:** The existing documentation has been restructured to follow the new format:
  - Section 1: Exposed Interfaces - All public methods and functions
  - Section 2: Internal Helpers - Private methods with implementation details
  - Added detailed explanations for each function with references to usage locations
  - Added proper function signatures in code blocks
  - Maintained the context-aware array naming section for additional clarity

### Previously Unclear Parts - Now Resolved

The following items were identified during the review and have been resolved:

1. **Global State Management:** ✅ RESOLVED - The global state management is now clearly documented with explanations of the design choice and usage patterns.

2. **Error Handling Strategy:** ✅ RESOLVED - The silent failure patterns are now documented with explanations of their purpose and impact on system robustness.

3. **AST Rewriting Integration:** ✅ RESOLVED - The interaction between `NamingManager` and the AST rewriting system is now clearly documented with flow explanations and cross-references.

4. **Semantic Name Attribute:** ✅ RESOLVED - Added comprehensive "Semantic Name Attribute System" section explaining the purpose, lifecycle, and usage patterns of `__assassyn_semantic_name__`.

## Additional Improvements Made

- **Cross-reference consistency**: Updated all references to use correct `.md` extensions
- **Integration clarity**: Enhanced explanations of how `NamingManager` coordinates with other naming components
- **Semantic name system**: Added comprehensive documentation of the `__assassyn_semantic_name__` attribute system
- **Context-aware naming**: Clarified the hierarchical naming system for modules and arrays

## Section 3: Status

**Status:** Completed - Documentation has been reorganized and updated according to new standards. The unclear parts identified above are noted for future investigation but do not prevent the current documentation from being functional and compliant with the new standards.
