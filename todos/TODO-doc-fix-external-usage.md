# TODO: Documentation Fix for External Usage Analysis

## Summary

Completed documentation review and creation for `analysis/external_usage.py` → `analysis/external_usage.md`. The documentation has been reorganized according to the new standards and moved to the DONE section.

## Areas Requiring Further Investigation

### 1. Module Interface Exposure Logic

**Issue**: The relationship between external usage analysis and module interface generation needs deeper documentation.

**Current Understanding**: 
- `expr_externally_used` is used in code generation to determine if expressions need to be exposed as module interfaces
- The `exclude_push` parameter specifically handles `FIFOPush` expressions differently

**Missing Knowledge**:
- Why `FIFOPush` expressions are treated specially in external usage analysis
- The complete logic flow from external usage detection to actual interface generation
- How this relates to the overall module design philosophy in Assassyn

**Recommendation**: This should be documented in a higher-level design document about module interfaces and code generation.

### 2. IR Structure Dependencies

**Issue**: The documentation references IR structure relationships that could be better explained.

**Current Understanding**:
- Functions rely on parent-child relationships in the IR
- `Operand` objects link expressions to their users
- Module containment is determined through block hierarchy

**Missing Knowledge**:
- Complete IR structure documentation that explains these relationships
- How the user-definer relationships are maintained and updated
- Performance implications of traversing these relationships

**Recommendation**: These concepts should be documented in the IR module documentation.

## Completed Work

1. ✅ Created comprehensive documentation following new standards
2. ✅ Analyzed function usage patterns in codebase
3. ✅ Documented both exposed interfaces and their behavior
4. ✅ Updated DOCUMENTATION-STATUS.md checklist
5. ✅ Moved item to DONE section

## No Critical Issues Found

The functions are well-implemented and their behavior is consistent with their names and documentation. No semantic changes were needed.
