# TODO: Documentation Review for rewrite_assign Module

## Section 1: Goal

Review and reorganize the documentation for `builder/rewrite_assign.py` according to the new documentation standards, ensuring all functions are properly documented with their usage patterns and project-specific knowledge.

## Section 2: Action Items

### Document Development

- [x] **Review existing documentation structure**: The original documentation was minimal and did not follow the new standards with proper sections for Exposed Interfaces and Internal Helpers.

- [x] **Analyze function usage patterns**: Searched through the codebase to understand how `rewrite_assign` and `__assassyn_assignment__` are used in the project.

- [x] **Reorganize documentation**: Restructured the documentation to follow the new standards with proper sections and detailed explanations.

### Coding Development

- [x] **Update documentation structure**: Reorganized `builder/rewrite_assign.md` to include:
  - Section 1: Exposed Interfaces (rewrite_assign, __assassyn_assignment__)
  - Section 2: Internal Helpers (AssignmentRewriter class and its methods)
  - Proper function signatures with parameters and return values
  - Detailed explanations linking to related modules

- [x] **Add project-specific knowledge**: Documented the relationship with the naming system and module decorator system.

- [x] **Update documentation status**: Moved the item from "TO CHECK" to "DONE" section in DOCUMENTATION-STATUS.md.

### Issues Identified and Resolved

1. **Documentation Structure**: The original documentation was too brief and lacked proper organization. Fixed by implementing the new documentation standards.

2. **Missing Context**: The original documentation didn't explain the relationship with the naming system. Added explanations linking to NamingManager and module decorator system.

3. **Incomplete Function Documentation**: The original documentation didn't properly document the AssignmentRewriter class and its methods. Added comprehensive documentation for all internal helpers.

### Remaining Considerations

No significant inconsistencies or unclear parts were identified during the review. The module's functionality is well-integrated with the naming system and the documentation now properly reflects its role in the AST rewriting process.

## Additional Improvements Made

- **Cross-reference consistency**: Updated all references to use correct `.md` extensions instead of `.py`
- **Integration clarity**: Enhanced explanations of how `rewrite_assign` integrates with `NamingManager`
- **Flow documentation**: Clarified the sequence of operations from AST rewriting to naming application

## Section 3: Verification

- [x] Documentation follows new standards with proper sections
- [x] All functions are documented with parameters and return values
- [x] Project-specific knowledge is explained with proper cross-references
- [x] No semantic changes were made to the actual implementation
- [x] Documentation status checklist updated accordingly
